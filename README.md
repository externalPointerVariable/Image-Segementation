# Image Segmentation

Welcome to the Image Segmentation project! This project utilizes machine learning techniques to classify images based on their provided characteristics.

## Description

Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels), each representing a distinct object or region within the image. This project employs a machine learning model to perform image segmentation, enabling accurate classification of images based on their features.

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- Bootstrap
- Python

## Deployment

The project website is currently live on [render.com](https://image-segementation.onrender.com). You can visit the website to experience the image segmentation model in action.

## Usage

To use the image segmentation model, follow these steps:

1. Visit the project website deployed on render.com.
2. Upload an image that you want to classify.
3. Wait for the model to process the image.
4. View the segmented image and its classification results.

## Development

If you're interested in contributing to the project or exploring its codebase, follow these steps to set up the development environment:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Explore the codebase to understand the implementation of the image segmentation model.
4. Make changes or improvements as desired.
5. Submit a pull request to contribute your changes to the project.
